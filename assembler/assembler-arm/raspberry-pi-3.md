# Raspberry Pi 3

Includes the `Broadcom BCM2837` SoC

> includes four high-performance ARM Cortex-A53 processing cores running at
> 1.2GHz with 32kB Level 1 and 512kB Level 2 cache memory, a VideoCore IV
> graphics processor, and is linked to a 1GB LPDDR2 memory module on the rear
> of the board.

* The Cortex-A53 supports the full ARMv8-A architecture.
* It not only runs 64-bit applications also seamlessly and efficiently runs legacy ARM 32-bit applications.


My Raspberry Pi 3

* has 31 general purpose 64-bit registers
* has 32 floating point (NEON) registers which are 128bits wide
