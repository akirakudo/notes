# Difference between su and sudo

* Unlike su(1), when sudo requires authentication, it validates the invoking
  user's credentials, not the target user's (or root's) credentials.
* This can be changed via the rootpw, targetpw and runaspw Defaults entries in
  sudoers.

`su` checks the _target_ user's credentials.
`sudo` checks the _invoking_ user's credentials

The sudoers file settings affect the following execution parameters:

* real and effective user ID
* real and effective group ID
* supplementary group IDs
* the environment list
* file creation mode mask (umask)

# Credential caching

* sudo uses time stamp files for credential caching.
* Once a user has been authenticated, the time stamp is updated and the user
  may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes
  unless overridden by the timeout option) .
* By default, sudo uses a tty-based time stamp which means that there is a
  separate time stamp for each of a user's login sessions.
* The tty_tickets option can be disabled to force the use of a single time
  stamp for all of a user's sessions.

* sudo requires that most users authenticate themselves by default.
* A password is not required if the invoking user
    1. is root
    2. if the target user is the same as the invoking user
    3. if the authentication has been disabled for the user or command in the
       sudoers file.

## /etc/sudoers

* config file for sudo
* edit with `visudo` as this does some format checking - breaking sudo would be bad
* if there are conflicting values the last value applied in the file wins
* comments prefix by `#` EXCEPT `#include` is a directive to include a file and is not a comment! W.T.F.
* contains
    1. aliases
        * basically variable definitions
        * can have of 4 types
            * User_Alias
                * specify groups of users
                * can include system groups e.g. `%www`
                * can include netgroups e.g. `+somegroup`
                * can prefix with `!` to exclude that user/group/netgroup
            * Runas_Alias
                * almost the same as user aliases but you can specify user by uid
            * Cmnd_Alias
                * lists of commands and directories
                * used to specify groups of commands
                * if you specify a dir it will include all files in that dir but not subdirs
            * Host_Alias
                * a list of
                    * hostnames,
                    * ip addresses,
                    * networks: if you don't specify netmask the netmask of this server will be used
                    * netgroups

        * each type has the `ALL` built-in alias that matches all users, all hosts etc.
        * you cannot override the ALL aliases
        * sudo knows which ALL you mean by the context of its use
    2. user specifications
        ```
        <user list> <host list> = <operator (runas) list> <tag list> <command list>
        ```
        * tags allow you to set special instructions for each user specification line e.g.
            * PASSWD
                * user must enter a password
            * NOPASSWD
                * user does not have to enter a password
            * NOEXEC
                * don't allow creating of a shell

```
# exclude joe
User_Alias ADMINS %admin, eoin, +somegroup !joe

# #0 is uid 0 here not a comment
Runas_Alias ROOT #0


Host_Alias SERVERS = 192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2, server1

Host_Alias INTERNAL_NETWORK = 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0

# And this is every machine in the network that is not a server
Host_Alias WORKSTATIONS = NETWORK, !SERVER



# User privilege specification
<root user> on <all hosts> = running as <any user> with <no tag restriction> can access <all commands>
root    ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# note that you don't have to create aliases - you can use users, hostnames
# etc. directly inline in the user specifications

myuser ALL = (root) NOPASSWD:NOEXEC: /usr/bin/vim
# lets myuser run vim as root without a pssword but vim cannot shell out via :shell
```

Default MacOS sudoers file:

```
## sudoers file.
##
## This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
## Failure to use 'visudo' may result in syntax or file permission errors
## that prevent sudo from running.
##
## See the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file.

## Options

sudo has many options which can be set in the config file

* env_reset
    * resets the terminal environment after switching to root. So, ie: all user
      set variables are removed
    * is set by default
* pwfeedback
    * shows users password feedback as they type

env_check
env_delete
use_loginclass

Options can be set by default via the `Defaults` command

```
Defaults        env_reset,pwfeedback
```
