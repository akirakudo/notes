## Machine learning

Good comparision of available libs: https://medium.com/@ricardo.guerrero/deep-learning-frameworks-a-review-before-finishing-2016-5b3ab4010b06#.hcp20j2se


Open source Libs

* Machine learning
    * Torch7
        * http://torch.ch/
        * a scientific computing framework
        * can be used for machine learning, computer vision
    * Deep learning
        * Tensor flow
            * https://www.tensorflow.org/
            * a lib for numerical computation using data flow graphs
            * is quite low level
        * Keras https://keras.io/
            * can use either keras or theano
            * higher level than either of them

* Anaconda
    > Anaconda is the leading open data science platform powered by Python. The open source version of Anaconda is a high performance distribution of Python and R and includes over 100 of the most popular Python, R and Scala packages for data science.
    >
    > Additionally, you'll have access to over 720 packages that can easily be installed with conda, our renowned package, dependency and environment manager, that is included in Anaconda.
It seems both Google and AWS will offer instances aimed specifically at machine learning workloads

Environments for running machine learning

* Amazon has announced they will provide FPGA support
    * https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M0AXXQB#product-description
* Google
    * will likely offer GPU support
    * has a REST api with some very high level APIs -  https://cloud.google.com/vision/
    * also has a ML cloud similar to AWS
        * https://cloud.google.com/ml/


Python seems to be the dominant language for machine learning work (libs are often written in C++ but have python interface)
