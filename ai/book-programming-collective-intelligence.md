## Chapter 1

* Machine learning is a sub section of AI concerned with algorithms which allow computers to learning
* All non-random data contains patterns
* If the machine can recognise the patterns it can _generalise_ about the data
* In order to generalise it trains a model with what it determines are the most important aspects of the data

How humans generalise  

1. You get lots of emails
1. You recognise that emails which contain "online pharmacy" are usually spam
1. You generalise to say that all emails which contain "online pharmacy"

Transparent vs Opaque ML algorithms

* Transparent
    * Some ML algorithms are transparent i.e an observer can totally understand how the computer came to its conclusion e.g. _decision tree_ algorithms.
* Opaque/black box
    * Others are "black box" i.e. it is very difficult/impossible to reproduce the reasoning behind the answer

Simple correlation analysis and regression are both basic forms of ML.

Algorithms have weaknesses

* they vary in their ability to  generalise over very large sets of patterns
* a pattern which is unlike any the algorithm has seen before is very likely to be misinterpreted
* machines can only generalise on data they have seen and even then in a very limited manner
* all machine learning methods suffer from a possibility of over generalising - as with most things in life, strong generalisations based on a few examples are rarely entirely accurate.
