* thumbs
    * ++ seems to have had higher engagement from users (netflix report 200% increase)
    * ++ easier for users to understand

> Instead of stars you will see a match rating under shows and movies in future. If something is nigh-on perfect for you, you might see a "95 per cent match", for example.

> A show that has less than a 50 per cent match won’t display a match-rating.

> According to the streaming service, you give a star rating to impress other people; it’s a way of channeling your inner critic. But delivering a simple yes-or-no verdict with your thumb? That’s brutal honesty, through and through. This strange reasoning is apparently why the company is moving to revamp its current star-based rating system
> “What’s more powerful: You telling me you would give five stars to the documentary about unrest in the Ukraine; that you’d give three stars to the latest Adam Sandler movie; or that you’d watch the Adam Sandler movie 10 times more frequently,” Yellin said. “What you do versus what you say you like are different things.” Of course, Netflix also gathers plenty of data on what you do—your viewing history is hugely important to the resulting algorithms. But the thumbs reflect that history far better, according to Yellin.
