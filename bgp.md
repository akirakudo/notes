# Border Gateway Protocol


* Current version is BGP 4
    * https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271
    * In use on Internet since 1994
    * Standardized since 2006

> BGP neighbors, called peers, are established by manual configuration among routers to create a TCP session on port 179. A BGP speaker sends 19-byte keep-alive messages every 60 seconds[5] to maintain the connection

> When BGP runs between two peers in the same autonomous system (AS), it is referred to as Internal BGP (iBGP or Interior Border Gateway Protocol). When it runs between different autonomous systems, it is called External BGP (eBGP or Exterior Border Gateway Protocol)
