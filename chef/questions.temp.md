Do we need berkshelf if we are using chef-solo

are we still using chef-solo or the more recent thing?

should I make rabid_base pass rubocop?


chef-zero
    vagrant uses chef-zero to provision, should it be updated too?
chef-solo
    ??? when do we use it?

do we need deploy user's password from the databag? should it be documented in readme?

what do
    roles
    data_bags
    environments
do?

is it worth using kitchen for testing instead of vargrant directly?
