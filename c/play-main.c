    // ******

    int things2[4] = { 3, 4, 6, 0 };

    // # Pointers

    // {type-pointed-to} *{name-of-pointer}
    // char *foo; // read it backwards: foo is a pointer to a char

    // ## indirection operator `*`
    // `*` in C is the 'indirection operator'
    // * it is used in two different contexts:
    //  1. creating pointers
    //  2. getting the value from a pointer (dereferencing a pointer)
    //  These contexts are not related.
    // it is used to get the value of a variable, the address of which is stored in a pointer

    // For example
    //```c
    char c = 'a';
    char *cp = &c; // context 1: creating cp as a pointer to c
    printf("Value of c is: %c\n", *cp); // context 2: dereferencing cp to get c
    //```


    // # Strings

    // string concatenation is done wiht whitepace
    printf("hello" "there"); // works!
    // * this lets you split long strings over multiple lines

    // * a string is an array of chars
    // * the length of hte array is the number of chars plus \0 (which terminates the string)

    // These are some ways of creating a string:
    char *greet = { 'H', 'i', ' ', 'y', 'o', 'u' };

    //char *greet2[] = "Hi you"; // same as above (remember you can omit array length if you are initializing it)

    // like numerical arrays if you don't give it enough elements in intiailziation it will fill it with nulls
    //char *long_greet[10] = "hi"; // {'h', 'i', \0, \0, \0 etc. }

    // Note: no string type (strings are just arrays of char)

    greet[0];   // H
    *greet;     // H (array name = pointer to first element

    greet[1];        // i
    (*greet + 1);    // i (using pointer arithmetic. remember sizeof(char) == 1)


    // arrays are just constant pointers
    char a[3] = { 'a', 'b', 'c' }; // a is a pointer. it holds the address of the first byte in the array
    // you cannot change what a points to using pointer math (the indirection operator)
    // for example a = a + 1 will not increment the memory address by one

    // you can however do this using ordinary pointers
    char *p1 = a;
    // p1 = p1 + 1; // now p1 points at the second element in the a array

    // In C: a is exactly the same as &a[0]
    // strings are just arrays
    // => strings are just constant pointers too
    char *p = "some stuff";

    // ## String functions

    // int puts(const char *str)
    puts("I do same thing as in ruby");


    // # Functions

    // * C functions pass args by value by default
    // * you can pass in a reference to the arg instead at call time if you want to pass by reference
    // int a = 1;
    // int b = 2;
    // void foo(x, y) { ... }
    // void bar(&x, y) { ... }
    // foo(a, b); // pass in a copy of a and b, a,b remain the same
    // bar(&a, b); // pass a reference to a and a copy of b
